// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = 'Considered part of the planning process, where you define the needs of each aspect of the project.';

const design = 'This step involves designing each aspect of the program, including UI, programming methods needed, security, and architecture.';

const implementation = 'Writing the code either solo, or in a team. Using version control, collaberating as a team, or brushing up on skills.';

const testingAndIntegration = 'Testing for bugs, security, user satisfaction, etc. Crucial for knowing if you have viable product.';
